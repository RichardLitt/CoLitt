This is the repository for coding developed or executed while being a Computational Linguistics student.

For the most part, that means homework assignments. There are occasional papers that are being written in here, as well. 

LingViz was a paper submitted to the LingViz conference in Avignon, April 28th, 2012. All .tex files, code, etc, are cc-share-alike by the authors.
