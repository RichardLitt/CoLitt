This is the repository for stuff developed while being a Computational Linguistics student.

For the most part, that means homework assignments. There are occasional papers that are being written in here, as well.

The ExamPrep folder is for revision. Feel free to edit away to your hearts content. 

LingViz was a paper submitted to the LingViz conference in Avignon, April 28th, 2012. All .tex files, code, etc, are cc-share-alike by the authors. 

Send a line if you're interested in anything.
