\section*{Class 1}
\begin{itemise}
\item Inferential Stats: modelling, estimate characteristics of whole population, how likely they behave the same way.
\item population: entire collection of events you're interested in. 
\item sample: actual set of observations
\item sampling frame: set of events/participants that can be measured (after pop defined)
\item sampling methods: simple random, systematic, stratified, cluster, convenience, quota.
\begin{itemise}
\item Simple random: each member equal chance of being included in sample. Good if homogenous.
\item Systematic: ordered, at pre-defined steps.
\item Stratified: sub-populations, measurements can very, samples taken {\it from} sub-populations. \\
Used when the population can be isolated and divided into similar groups.
\item Cluster: Split into groups, random sampling from clusters, then they all go back into the whole sample.
\item Convenience: as random as possible. Good for pretests.
\item Quote: predefined categories to be included. Not random. 
\end{itemise}
\item Sampling error = estimation error = sample-to-sample variation due to chance
\item Sampling distribution = the distribution of a stat over repeated sampling from a pop, or the degree of variability between samples expected by chance as a function of the sampling error.
\item Observational linguistics: Variables are controlled, relationships between variables are correlated.
\item Experimental: variables manipulated, how they affect each other is causal. 
\end{itemise}
\section*{Class 2}
\begin{itemise}
\item Variables: things we measure/register or manipulate/control
\item DV: what is measured/registered in the study
\item IV (predictor): what we manipulate. 
\item Levels: one factor in different amount of levels (?)
\item Discrete var: small set of possible values
\item Continuous variables: any value
\item Null Hypothesis (H0) = there is no difference.
\item Alt Hypo. (H1) = there is a relationship.
\item Type 1 error: H0 rejected  = false positive = alpha
\item Type 2 error: H0 accepted even though H1 was true = false negative = beta
\item Scales of measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, INterval, Ratio
\begin{itemise}
\item Nominal: predefined categories
\item Ordinal: ranked for category, but distances not measured
\item Interval: ranked, same difference between
\item Ratio: Interval with an absolute zero
\end{itemise}
\item Discrete (categorical) variables: nominal, ordinal
\item Continuous: interval, ratio scale
\item Likert scale: on a -2...2 scale
\item Can rescale Ratio $\rightarrow$ Interval $\rightarrow$ Ordinal $\rightarrow$ Nominal, but not other way around.
\item Designs: Within, between subjects, mixed desing.
\begin{itemise}
\item Within: Each gets test materal from each condition for all levels of IV. No systematic differences for different sets.
\item Between: Participants in groups: each gets one condition. Need to control for different features across groups.
\item Mixed: Some between, some within. 
\end{itemise}
\item Long data format: Each observation in its own row: Columns code relevant information.
\end{itemise}
