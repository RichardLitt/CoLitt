  - Write the methodology section
  - refine which features to use
  - reclean data based on those features.

Results:
  graph 1: languages in area vs. languages used
    - Use file geo_yim
        For this file, I decided not to print out the number of printed objects that would be inlcuded over a certain threshold. For one, that may change. For two, it's hard enough dealing with the language families and the amount of fill to plot.
        For the file = code lang_name amount_of_things_filled amount_total percentage distance_from_yim long lat(or maybe lat long) family genus subfamily iso_code
    - Should be sorted by longitude and latitude
    - Should have the radius (500km) on it
    - Should use different tokens for different families
    - Should use scaling to show the difference in cleanliness
    - Can use thresh-hold amounts used in heatmaps, if you want (top 15)

  graph 2: geographic languages, centred, tagged for family
    - Centroid language, distance above then below then above in ranking
    - Tagged for families in the label (for instance, *, or superscript)
    - Tagged possibly by column colour

  graph 3: phylogenetic languages geographically ordered
    - Non-planar organisation, but rather by coordinates
    - Tagged for subfam, genus, fam differences in the labels
    - Still centroid

  graph 4: Geographically ordered by longitude or lattitude.
    - Same as above, but not centered, going from left to right
    - Perhaps use English as a starter or a center for this.
