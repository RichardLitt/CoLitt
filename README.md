Co(mputational) Li(inguistics)tt(auer)
======================================

This is my computational linguistics repository. The code here was written either while attending the University of Edinburgh, or Saarland University.

There are occasional papers that are being written in here, as well.

* The *ExamPrep* folder is for revision. Feel free to edit away to your hearts content.
* *Diversity* is the beginnings of a paper looking at mathematically modelling language diversity. 
* Simulating Language contains all of the code given to me or edited by me during the *Simulating Language* course at the University of Edinburgh in 2009, taught by Simon Kirby and Andrew Smith. As there was no copyright on it anywhere, I assume it is ok for me to share these files.
